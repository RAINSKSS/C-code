A murder case occurred somewhere in Japan. The police determined that the murderer must be one of the four suspects through investigation.





The following are the confessions of the four suspects:





A said: Not me.



B said: It's C.



C said: It's D.



D said: C is talking nonsense



It is known that 3 people told the truth and 1 person told a lie.





Now please write a program to determine who is the murderer according to the information.

#include<stdio.h>


int main()
{
	char killer = 'A';
	for (killer = 'A'; killer <= 'D'; killer++)
	{
		if ((killer != 'A') + (killer == 'C') + (killer == 'D') + (killer != 'D') == 3)
		{
			printf("The killer is %c", killer);
		}
	}
	return 0;
}
