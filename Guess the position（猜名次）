Five athletes participated in the 10m platform diving competition and were asked to predict the results:





A player said: B second, I third;



Player B said: I am the second and E is the fourth;



Player C said: I am the first, and D is the second;



Player D said: "At last, I am the third;";



E player said: I am the fourth, A is the first;



After the competition, each contestant is half right. Please program to determine the ranking.

#include<stdio.h>


int main()
{
	int A = 0;
	int B = 0;
	int C = 0;
	int D = 0;
	int E = 0;
	for (A = 1; A <= 5; A++)
	{
		for (B = 1; B <= 5; B++)
		{
			for (C = 1; C <= 5; C++)
			{
				for (D = 1; D <= 5; D++)
				{
					for (E = 1; E <= 5; E++)
					{
						if ((A == 3) + (B == 2) == 1 &&
							(B == 2) + (E == 4) == 1 &&
							(C == 1) + (D == 2) == 1 &&
							(D == 3) + (C == 5) == 1 &&
							(E == 4) + (A == 1) == 1 &&
							A * B * C * D * E == 120)
						{
							printf("A = %d, B = %d, C = %d, D = %d, E = %d", A, B, C, D, E);
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
	return 0;
}
